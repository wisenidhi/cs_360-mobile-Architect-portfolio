Welcome to my portfolio! I'm **Nidhi Shree**, a Mobile Architecture student, and this repository showcases my work, including the Weight Tracker app. This app helps users monitor their weight and achieve fitness goals. I’m focused on building simple, effective mobile apps with clean design and solid functionality.
# Weight Tracker App

Welcome to my Weight Tracker app! This app helps users track their weight and stay motivated to achieve their fitness goals by setting target weights and receiving notifications when they reach their goals.

## Features

- **Login/Registration**: Users can sign in with their email or username and password. New users can create an account and store login credentials in the local database.
- **Weight Tracking**: Users can log their weight daily and view the progress in a list format.
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set a goal weight, and the app will track their progress towards that goal.
- **SMS Notifications**: Users receive an SMS notification when they reach their goal weight. If the user denies permission to send SMS, the feature is disabled, but the app remains fully functional.
- **Simple Interface**: The app offers a user-friendly interface with easy navigation, making it simple for users to input and track their data.

## User Flow

1. **Login Screen**: Users log in with their email/username and password. New users can create an account.
2. **Weight Log Screen**: Once logged in, users see a list of their past weights and dates. An "Add Weight" button allows them to input their latest weight.
3. **Add Weight Screen**: Users enter their weight for the day. The weight is stored in the database and the log is updated.
4. **Goal Screen**: Users can set or adjust their goal weight. This goal will be saved and visible each time they log in.
5. **SMS Alert Setup**: Users can enter their phone number to receive an SMS when their goal weight is reached.
6. **Logout**: Users can log out of the app at any time.

## How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1. **Login**: Users log in using their credentials.
2. **Weight Log**: Users view past weight data and can add new entries.
3. **Set Goal**: Users can set a target weight and track progress towards that goal.
4. **Receive Notification**: Users get an SMS when their goal weight is reached.




In this version, everything important is covered — from features and functionality to installation — but there are no images. You can always come back later and add them if needed.
