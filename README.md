Welcome to my portfolio! I'm **Nidhi Shree**, a Mobile Architecture student, and this repository showcases my work, including the Weight Tracker app. This app helps users monitor their weight and achieve fitness goals. I’m focused on building simple, effective mobile apps with clean design and solid functionality.
